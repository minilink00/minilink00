Hi, this is Minilink06!

I'm currently studying to get a degree on Cmputer Sciences un UADE, Argentina.

My main intrests are:
- Cybersecurity
- Linux, bash scripting and server maintance
- Porgramming (obviously)
- Both frontend and backend (but I steer more towards backend)

Not much more to say in here. I have a C2 in english and I dont use AI for studying at all, partly because I dont like stuff being handed to me and also because I've seen how it affects studying, development and performance on other students all arround the world, however I think that when used responsibly and it's responses are thoroughly checked, it can be really usefull.
